                    <strong>Programming</strong>
                    <br>
                    I'm a programmer who focuses on Web development. I'm most at home in Python, but you'll find me using C# quite a bit as well. When I'm not being paid to program I end up making games! I've made a few games in Godot and have really enjoyed it, you can check them out on my itch.io page!

                    I'm a longtime vegan and a newly started Kombucha brewer! I really enjoy trying new foods and developing my skill in the kitchen.

                    <strong>Other hobbies</strong>
                    <br>
                    Lifelong gamer here. I like most game geners but definitely have a soft spot for rouge likes, first person shooters, and spooky games :) My backlog is growing faster than my "completed" list which is my biggest problem with gaming.
                    <br>
                    When I'm not in front of a screen you'll probably see me on a run. Running is one of those hobbies that snuck up on me, where I initially just wanted to get in shape, but now I actually look forward to, and enjoy my time running.
